# PROGRAM THE DRUM PART THE GAME
## Objective
    The objective of this game is to teach the user how to program drums using a drum pattern grid and teach basic rythms. I chose this to create game as I'm a drummer who hates to program drums, but likes to teach people about music and how it is made. I've always wanted to code something that at least resembles a drum machine/programming grid and this is the perfect oppertunity to combine that with a game. 

## Game Rules 
    - There are 5 levels of 3 rounds
    - A drumloop will be played and you must recreate the part on drum programming grid
    - To win a round, you must recrete the drum loop correctly on the grid
    - To move on to the next level, you must recreate 2 of the 3 drum loops correctly 
    - If you make it through all 5 levels, you win
    - If you fail more than one drum loop on a level, you loose and are returned to the beginning
